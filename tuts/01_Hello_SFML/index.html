	This tutorial assumes you already have SFML setup.  If that is not the case,
	a tutorial will be written for that eventually, but for right now follow <a
	href="https://www.sfml-dev.org/tutorials/2.5/start-linux.php">this link</a>
	to get SFML installed.
	</p>

	<p class="words">
	The first thing we want is a window.  SFML includes several different
	modules, but for right now we just care about the Window one.
	</p>
	<div class="code">// We are using SFML
#include &ltSFML/Window.hpp&gt

const int W_WIDTH = 800;
const int W_HEIGHT = 600;

int main(){
	sf::Window window(sf::VideoMode(W_WIDTH, W_HEIGHT), "SFML Now!");

}</div> <!-- code -->

	<p class="words">
	The first argument (videoMode) declares the size of the window (not including
	the boarders and title bar), and the second argument is the title of the
	window.<br><br>

	Right now though, we have a problem: a window shows up, but it immediately
	closes.  We need a way to keep the window open until we close it ourselves.
	Fortunately, we can just poll for events that are also included in SFML.
	</p>

	<div class="code">// We are using SFML
#include &ltSFML/Window.hpp&gt

const int W_WIDTH = 800;
const int W_HEIGHT = 600;

int main( ) {
	sf::Window window(sf::VideoMode(W_WIDTH, W_HEIGHT), "SFML Now!");

	while ( window.isOpen()) {
		// check the window's events that were just done
		sf::Event event;
		while ( window.pollEvent( event ) ) {
			// Just handling the close event now.
			if ( event.type == sf::Event::Closed ) {
				window.close();
			}
		}
	}
}</div> <!-- code -->

	<p class="words">
	This code opens the window and keeps it open now, only closing when we tell
	it to close.  Now we can actually drag the window around and begin to imagine
	to do things with it.<br><br>
